# Purpose

These scripts create daily survey station daily temperature and anomaly plots as the ships work their way through the Bering Sea. These ships are conducting NOAA Fisheries' Alaska Fisheries Science Center's fisheries independent surveys in the Eastern Bering Sea. Scripts pull temperatures from google drive, entered by FPCs at sea, create daily maps and composite gifs, and then push the maps to google drive for the communications team. These plots are displayed on the AFSC website

# Notes

 - [How to set up the task scheduler](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwBmR6AqgnvUx_AiWYQxtYxIRjWMfdd5EPWwFvpI3Ug/edit)
 - Files are saved to our internal dev FTP server and google drive. 
 - Troubleshooting: if the task scheduler fails to run the code, but you can run the script in R or Rstudio, you may need to update Pandoc. If you are on a NOAA machine, ask IT to install the .msi file for you. Close and reopen everything and try again.
